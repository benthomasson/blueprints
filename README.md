# Blueprints

Blueprints are a way to describe what you want to build, tear down, remediate,
or upgrade.  A blueprint contains a schema that defines what is going to be
built, the dependency relationships between components in the blueprint, and
external dependencies that need to be met before the blueprint can be built.

## Blueprints have:

* Type definitions of components
* Dependencies between components
* Type definitions of inputs and outputs
* External dependencies
* References to component blueprints

### Blueprints allow for:

* Declarative automation
* Low-code/no-code automation
* UI representation of resources and automation
* Type checking
